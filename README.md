php-Korean-romanizer
====================

PHP 5.4+ library to romanize Korean in UTF-8 format.

==WORK IN PROGRESS==

Uses the <strong>"[Revised Romanization of Korean (국어의 로마자 표기법)](http://www.korean.go.kr/eng/roman/roman.jsp)"</strong> which is the official Korean language romanization system in South Korea proclaimed by Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean). 

Notice that this is different from <strong>transliteration</strong>, which comes implemented in PHP's [intl extension](http://php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php) ([Transliterator class](http://php.net/manual/en/class.transliterator.php)).
For example, 왕십리 subway stop is transliterated as _wangsibli_ but romanized as _wangsimni_ (which is closer to the Korean pronuntiation).
